Technical Notes - RNNoise
================================================================================
RNNoise was trained on normal speaking levels. Very loud audio could cause
artifacts if fed directly to the neural network. Limitr addresses this with
a dual-limiter architecture:

  Source → Compressor → [PreLimiter] → NoiseSuppression → EQ → [Limiter] → Output

The PreLimiter is a fixed safety limiter (always -1dB) that only activates
when noise suppression is enabled, protecting RNNoise from loud transients.
The user-controllable Limiter sits at the end of the chain, preventing
clipping from EQ boosts or auto-gain adjustments.
