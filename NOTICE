Technical Notes - RNNoise
================================================================================
RNNoise was trained on normal speaking levels. Very loud audio could cause
artifacts if fed directly to the neural network. Limitr addresses this by
placing the compressor/limiter BEFORE noise suppression in the signal chain:

  Source → Compressor → NoiseSuppression → EQ → Output

This ensures loud sounds (donation alerts, meme SFX, etc.) are tamed before
reaching RNNoise, preventing robotic/static artifacts.
